      <h2>Fund It Forward - Case Study</h2>
      <p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/nickwu78/CFA-Major-Project-T2">Link</a></p>
      <p>Website: <a href="http://fund-it-forward.herokuapp.com">Link</a>
      <p>Fund it forward brings together crowdsourcing donations for social causes and the idea of "paying it forward".

      Requests are posted in the form of projects, and are funded by people looking to donate.

      Once your project is fully funded, you nominate a project to "pay forward" (donate) 10% of the funds.

      It turns the act of passively receiving donations into an active act of giving back and feeding back into the community and the causes which you support.

      It allows people who donate to see not only the projects they have funded, but all the other projects they have indirectly helped.</p>

      <h3>Project Requirements & Deliverables</h3>
      <p>"You are to design, build, deploy and present a Ruby on Rails application. The project is to be completed individually."

      Your application must impress one person/group from this list:

      Barack Obama (politics)
      Rupert Murdoch (journalism)
      Bill & Melinda Gates (social causes/global development)
      Each person/group was chosen to represent a particular industry as well as certain expectations and standards.</p>
      <h3>Ideation</h3>
      <p>Although I had ideas on what I wanted to build, I wanted to make sure to properly address the project requirements. Since it is open-ended, the first thing I did was a thorough research process on each person (Barack Obama, Rupert Murdoch, Bill Gates). Whenever possible, I tried to link causes that each person supported with broad ideas, and facts & figures.
      
      I closed in on three main areas of interest:

      Fiancial services for the poor / developing countries
      Tackling fake news in journalism
      Poverty

      Under each area, I continued to brainstorm ideas:

      Micro-lending; Micro-finance; Peer-to-peer money transfers
      Platform to rate news-articles on accuracy; Crowd-sourced fact-checking;
      Platform to enable refugees to fund their projects or get work;

      I ruled out certain ideas based on complexity, and/or not following the project requirements.

      Eventually found myself drawn to the idea of crowd-funding for donations. As I was looking to create a different angle on the model, I came across a video which reminded me of the ALS Ice-bucket challenge. The concept of nominating another person to take the challenge and donate appealed to me on many levels, so I decided to create a crowd-funding donations platform, where you nominate the next project after your own project has been funded.
      </p>
      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>I chose to tackle the issue of poverty. According to the World Bank, an estimated 10.7% of the world's population live in poverty.

      Those stuck in the poverty trap often lack business capital. For those who want to start businesses, or fund projects, it is difficult to access funding.

      Bank-loans are hard to come by due to lack of credit history or collateral. Traditional micro-lending often imposes high rates of interest.

      Charitable donations often face similar issues, with charities facing high costs of administration, meaning less money is distributed to the needy.

      For those who donate, it's hard to see where your money is going, and the impact that it is having. I also found the act of donating - whilst being fulfilling - is ultimately a passive process: You gave the money, and often forgot about it. The money ends at the recipient, and goes no further.

      Crowd-funding is a popular way to raise money outside of the traditional channels, but there are problems with the major companies.

      Kickstarter is geared more towards entrepreneurs pitching new products rather than donations for disadvantaged people to start projects, and their rules are strict in terms of only supporting a small number of countries.

      Kiva is a "kickstarter for donations", however it works through an intermediary, so as a person wanting funding, you would need to find another organisation to assist you in listing your ideas and pitch.

      To address these problems, my solution is to create a crowd-sourced donations platform, supporting projects by people in disadvantaged situations. In order to keep the cycle of donations going, once a project is fully funded, the project owner is asked to immediately nominate another project of their choice to donate 10% to.

      I hope this will create incentives for people to help others in their communities, and to keep going the act of giving.

      For people who donate, it allows them to see a link between projects they have funded, and other projects they have indirectly contributed to. It allows you to visualize a tree-like structure of all the people, and causes you have helped. Because you can see where your money is going, and the flow-on effects, I hope it will give extra incentive for people to donate.</p>
